## ver 0.1, April 22, 2024
### Introduction:
Welcome to the latest release of our software! Version 0.1 brings initial featuers for data engineers, scientist and developers to run data catalog on top of Apache Spark.

### Key Highlights:
Introducing data catalog for the preparing data at any scale in ad-hoc analytics, data warehouse, lake house and ML project

###New Features:
* Multi level namespaces: User can create anonymous name space

* Management of source system endpoint : Lightning catalog manages an endpoint of source system providing unified access to them through SQL and Apache SPARK API, which makes data discovery easy.

* Query(SQL) capabilities : Lightning catalog allows to run ad-hoc query(SQL) over underlying heterogenous source systems in federate way, E,g Join between multiple source system without moving data.

* Create virtual db schema : Lightning catalog allows to create virtual DB schema that keeps tables from different data sources

* Supported data sources:
```bash
DeltaLake
Iceberg
H2
Snowflake
Posstgres
Oracle
Mssql
