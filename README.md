## Lightning Catalog

Lightning catalog is an open source data catalog for the preparing data at any scale in ad-hoc analytics, data warehouse, lake house and ML project

## Key Capabilities
* Lightning catalog manages an endpoint of source system providing unified access to them  through SQL and Apache SPARK API, which makes data discovery easy.
* Lightning catalog allows to run ad-hoc query(SQL) over underlying heterogenous source systems in federate way, E,g Join between multiple source system without moving data.
* Lightning catalog simplify the life cycle of data engineering pipe line, build, test and deploy by leveraging Data Flow Table, E,g Load data into lake house by fetching delta and transform all the way of SQL operation.
* Lightning catalog can get rid of burden of data preparation workload for ML engineer, and help them focusing on building model. It supports to access to unstructured data.

## Online Documentation
* The latest documentation is found on the [project web page](https://www.zetaris.com/lightning-opensource)
* git hub online [doc](https://github.com/zetaris/lightning-catalog/tree/master/doc/doc)

## Collaboration

Lightning tracks issues in GitHub and prefers to receive contributions as pull requests.


### Building - backend

Lightning is built using Gradle with Java 1.8 or Java 11.

* To invoke a build and run tests: `./gradlew build`
* To skip tests: `./gradlew build -x test -x integrationTest`
* To fix code style for default versions: `./gradlew spotlessApply`
* To fix code style for all versions of Spark/Hive/Flink:`./gradlew spotlessApply -DallVersions`
* To build with spark version profile: `./gradlew clean build -DdefaultSparkMajorVersion=3.4 -DdefaultSparkVersion=3.4.2`  
* distribution package is found `lightning-metastore/spark/spark_version(v3.3, v3.4, v3.5)/spark-runtime/build/distributions`=

### Execution

* To run and execute : ./doc/spark-shell/start-thriftserver-ligt.sh

The script will automatically search for the Spark installation path. 
If it cannot locate Spark, it will download the appropriate version into the doc folder.

The GUI will be available soon. Please stay tuned! :)

### Major Features

* Running catalog in file system( HDFS, Blob, and local file) which allows version control.
* Support Apache Spark Plug-in architecture
* Support running data pipeline at any scale by leveraging Apache Spark.
* Support running ANSI SQL and Hive QL over underlying source systems.
* Support multiple namespace.
* Support data quality by integrating Amazon Deequ
* Support data flow table, declarative ETL framework which define transforms your data.
* Support processing unstructured data, accessing all files and their meta data recursively from an endpoint.
